            <h3>IBM iX Adobe</h3>

            <h3>Lucid</h3>
            <p>For the Lucid Design Jam, we were to rethink the on-boarding process for their users and decrease the number of users that left the site after one or two interactions. They provided us with the statistics of users that left the site after which interactions. Using this data, we were able to pinpoint which interaction we wanted to improve.</p>

            <h3>Deloitte</h3>
            <p>For the Deloitte Design Jam, we were to develop a data driven solution that will increase college football viewership (in person and online). We were given some data that Deloitte had already to help solve this problem. We did more research online as well to understand the issue more deeply.</p>

            <h3>Great Lakes</h3>
            <p>In the Great Lakes Design Jam we worked to help tourists and locals understand the dangers of drowning on the great lakes. Surprisingly, a large number of individuals who are from Michigan or from around the great lakes areas are common victims. We wanted to find a way to educate people on water safety as well as encourage the use of life vests.</p>
