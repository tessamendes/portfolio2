          <h3>Money Envelopes</h3>
          <p>Money Envelopes app aims to help young professional better manage their money and spending by visually representing how much money they have budgeted for the week.</p>
          <p>I will be attempting to meet these target usersâ€™ needs for an easy saving and budgeting platform. I would like to extinguish the belief that users do not make enough to save or should prioritize paying off debt first before saving for retirement or emergencies.</p>

          <p>The Minimalife (Minimal Life) app aims to help the user reduce the number of material items one owns and buys in order to help achieve financial freedom and peace of mind. </p> 
          <p>This app uses positive reinforcement, gamification and statistical habit tracking to motivate users with their past success, and encourage them when they are struggling.</p>

          <h3>Yelp Usability</h3>
          <p>Yelp guerilla-style usability test to identify issues with ordering take-out or delivery from restaurants.</p>
          <p>
          There were two major questions I sought out to answer: Can users easily search for places that offer take-out or delivery? Can users save a place for later quickly if they are looking at multiple menus?
